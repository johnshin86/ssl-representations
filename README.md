# SSL Representations

This library implements many recent vision SSL methods, as well as uncertainty estimation methods built on top of these methods. 

Self-supervised learning in vision is an interplay of the augmentation policy, the inductive bias of the architecture,
and the interactions across samples induced by the loss function. The library was initially built from the facebook VICReg repo,
but has been heavily modified.
